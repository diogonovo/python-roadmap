Python Roadmap: 
This repository documents my journey through a structured roadmap to become an expert in Python, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced programming techniques. The goal is to not only master the language but also explore areas like Data Science, Machine Learning, and application development.

Roadmap Structure
Introduction to Python

Fundamentals of the language, syntax, variables, control structures, functions, etc.
Intermediate Python

Object-oriented programming, file handling, modules, packages, etc.
Advanced Python

Memory management, asynchronous programming, metaprogramming, etc.
Libraries and Frameworks

NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Flask, Django, and more.
Practical Projects

Real-world projects to solidify knowledge and build practical applications.
Objective
The goal of this roadmap is to develop a deep understanding of Python and its applications in the real world. I will be updating this repository as I progress, adding notes, code examples, and links to useful resources.
